# Carbs vs. Protein - A Scrote Jenkins Story

**Genre**: Tower Defense, Survival  
**Platform**: PC, MacOS (itch.io)

## Overview
**Carbs vs. Protein - A Scrote Jenkins Story** is a survival tower defense game where you defend your meat castle against waves of enemies. You strategically place castle tiles, turrets, and deploy scrotes to repair walls as you gather resources by defeating enemies. The aim is simple: survive for as long as possible while managing your resources, fending off enemies, and repairing your castle walls before they fall and you lose the game.

## Gameplay

### Objective:
- **Survive**: Build, defend, and repair your castle while enemies spawn and attempt to destroy your walls.

### Core Mechanics:
- **Enemy Spawners**: Spawners appear randomly on the map and begin spawning enemies only after you've placed your first castle tile.
- **Castle Tiles**: Once a meat castle tile is placed, you can build turrets and scrotes to defend and repair your base.
- **Resources**: Manage three key resources gained by killing enemies:
  - **Meat**: Used to build castle tiles.
  - **Skin**: Used to repair castle walls.
  - **Bones**: Used to construct turrets.
- **Turrets**: Place turrets to automatically attack enemies and prevent them from reaching your castle.
- **Scrotes**: Deploy scrotes inside the castle walls to assist in repairing damaged tiles.
- **Survival**: If any wall tile's health reaches zero, you lose the game.

### Controls:
- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Move the camera around the map.
- **Mouse**: Select tiles and place them on the map.
- **Toolbar**: Located at the bottom of the screen, use it to select and build:
  - **Castle Tile**: Build meat castle walls.
  - **Turret Tile**: Build turrets inside the castle walls to defend against enemies.
  - **Scrote Tile**: Deploy scrotes for repairs.
- **Esc**: Pause the game.

## How to Play

### 1. Starting the Game:
- Upon starting the game, click the **Start** button to begin.
- Enemy spawners will randomly appear on the map but will not spawn enemies until you place your first castle tile.

### 2. Building Your Castle:
- Use the toolbar at the bottom of the screen to place a **Meat Castle Tile**. This is your first defense structure.
- Once the meat castle tile is placed, you can:
  - **Build Turrets**: Select the **Turret Tile** from the toolbar to place turrets that will automatically attack enemies.
  - **Deploy Scrotes**: Select the **Scrote Tile** to deploy scrotes that will repair damaged castle walls.

### 3. Defending Against Enemies:
- As enemies spawn, they will attempt to attack and destroy the castle walls. Each enemy has a visible health bar, and your turrets will automatically target and damage them.
- If an enemy reaches your castle walls, they will start attacking it. Each wall tile has its own health bar, and if any tile's health depletes entirely, you lose the game.

### 4. Managing Resources:
- **Meat**: Required for building new castle tiles.
- **Skin**: Needed for repairing damaged walls.
- **Bones**: Required to build new turrets.
- Resources are collected by defeating enemies, and can be spent to build and repair your structures.

### 5. Losing the Game:
- The game ends when any wall tile's health reaches zero. Protect your walls and make use of scrotes to keep them repaired!
